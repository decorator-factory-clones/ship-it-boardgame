Boardgame for people who love IT.
It is built for fun, social interactions, memes, and a little bit of strategy.

No real IT skills are required to play this game :)

## Play

- [Online via Table Top Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3172213526) or create your own [Table Top Simulator](https://github.com/sobolevn/ship-it-boardgame/blob/master/table-top-simulator.md) version

## Rules and languages

- [Russian](https://github.com/sobolevn/ship-it-boardgame/blob/master/ru/rules.md) ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º

## TODO

This is the earliest release of the game.

What I still have to do:
- [x] Understand how to easily print it
- [x] Play it myself, make others play it
- [ ] Collect feedback (please create GitHub [issues](https://github.com/sobolevn/ship-it-boardgame/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/sobolevn/ship-it-boardgame/discussions) for any feedback)
- [ ] Improve the game: the wording, balance, some mechanics
- [x] Work on branding: logo, card design, etc
- [x] Create tooling to be able to use [Table Top Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3172213526) for playtests
- [ ] Translate the better version of it into english
- [ ] Maybe even publish it officially

All possible income of this game will support my other OpenSource projects!

## Inspirations

What this game is like?

I once played https://www.deployordie.com/ game,
which motivated me to invent my own game in a similar setting.

Some people say that this game has some similarities to
- https://explodingkittens.com
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)

TLDR:

- You can fork and change it (attribution and same license required)
- You cannot sell it, it would not be fair
